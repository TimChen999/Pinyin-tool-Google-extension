/**
 * Shared "+ Vocab" capture pipeline.
 *
 * The in-page content script (src/content/content.ts) and the
 * in-extension reader (src/reader/reader.ts) both register a vocab
 * callback with the overlay module. They used to inline identical
 * gate -> trim -> translate logic, which let one caller drift out of
 * sync with the wire format the service worker reads -- a real bug
 * we hit when only content.ts was migrated to the {word, example}
 * RECORD_WORD shape and the reader path silently kept sending
 * {word, context}, dropping every reader-side example sentence.
 *
 * Centralising the body here means there is one place to update the
 * pipeline, and one place a future regression has to slip through.
 *
 * Pipeline:
 *  1. Run the captured surrounding context through the
 *     example-quality gate (isUsableExample).
 *  2. If it passes, trim at clause boundaries (trimSentenceForExample)
 *     so the stored snippet reads like a single thought.
 *  3. Send RECORD_WORD with `{word, example}` so the service worker
 *     persists immediately. Awaiting the on-device Translator before
 *     this would block the user's "Added" feedback in the overlay.
 *  4. Asynchronously translate via the on-device Translator API
 *     (which needs the user activation the +Vocab click supplies);
 *     when it resolves, ship SET_EXAMPLE_TRANSLATION so the SW
 *     patches the stored example with its English translation.
 *
 * Failure modes are silent on purpose: the word still lands in the
 * vocab list even when no usable context is captured or the
 * Translator API is unavailable. The user can re-trigger translation
 * later from the hub's "Translate" button.
