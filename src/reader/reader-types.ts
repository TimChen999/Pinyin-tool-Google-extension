 *   - EPUB: a CFI string that epub.js can `display()` directly.
 *   - DOM: an absolute character offset against `contentEl.textContent`.
 *   - Subtitle: cue index + offset within that cue (more resilient to
 *     parser changes than a transcript-wide offset).
 *   - PDF: page + textContent item index + offset within the item's str
 *     (survives zoom/rerender since item indices are stable).
 *
 * `word` plus `contextBefore`/`contextAfter` exist as a snippet-based
 * fallback for any renderer that wants to re-locate the word when its
 * primary anchor doesn't resolve cleanly (e.g. EPUB CFI drift across
 * epub.js version bumps, mammoth/marked output changes between sessions).
